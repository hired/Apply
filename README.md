### In Soviet Russia, company apply to you!

Well, this isn't quite Soviet Russia, but that's the motto that Hired believes in. We've created a marketplace that brings companies to your doorstep. Engineers who sign up on Hired will receive interview requests from a wide range of companies, where they disclose compensation details upfront. 

### Stop working with ***non-technical*** "technical" recruiters

We're a software company built by engineers. **We are not a recruiting firm.** We provide a platform that connects engineers and companies. We've eliminated the need for the middleman and give you direct access to hundreds of employers. 

### How does this work?

  * Sign up for Hired -- www.hired.com/apply
  * Fill out your profile
  * Pick a week when you'd like to go live

During that week, 100's of employers will review your profile. If they see a fit they will request that you interview with. In that interview request, they will disclose **title, salary and equity** 

Is there a company you're interested in but they haven't viewed you? No problem, let us know and will make sure they review it.
