Hired
=====

In Soviet Russia you don't apply to company, company apply to you!


Well, this isn't quite Soviet Russia, but that's the motto that Hired believes in. We've created a marketplace that brings companies to your doorstep. Engineers who sign up on Hired will receive interview requests from a wide range of companies, where they disclose compensation details upfront. 

We've eliminated the need for the middleman and have created a candidate centric approach with distribution to massive pool of companies.

So, do you want to help us put those pesky non-technical "technical" recruiters out of business? Want to be a part of the solution? Want to join a company that has a market opportunity the size of Switzerland's GDP? Well, join us!

But the most exciting part of Hired? Its our Angular and Rails platform. Thats how we can take hundreds of candidates, introduce them to hundreds of employers and all have it work without Johnny recruiter needing to be in the mix.
